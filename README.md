# WebScraping100Movies
This program scrapes the website https://www.timeout.com/film/best-movies-of-all-time with 100 movies. 

It takes the movies name, release year, duration, link to the movie's blub/short description(if it has it, cause not all of them do), and finally a frameshot of the movie on the website. 

The program puts the name, duration, release year and blurb link and puts them all into an Excel table, and downloads all the frameshot images for every movies from the website(if a movie has one), renames them so that the images name and number matches the movie name in the Excel table, and saves them into a separate folder. 

The user inputs the path to the folder where he wants the Excel file and the folder with the images saved
